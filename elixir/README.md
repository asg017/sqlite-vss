# SqliteVss

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `sqlite_vss` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:sqlite_vss, "~> 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Now you can install sqlite_vss by running:

`$ mix sqlite_vss.install`

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/sqlite_vss>.
